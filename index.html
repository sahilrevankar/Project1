      Released in <em>2017</em> as the grand finale to S. S. Rajamouli’s
      two-part epic, <strong>Baahubali 2: The Conclusion</strong> is a landmark
      of Indian cinema that resolved the famous cliffhanger of why the loyal
      Kattappa killed the heroic Amarendra Baahubali. The film blends ancient
      mythology with high-octane action, following Mahendra Baahubali’s quest to
      avenge his father’s murder and reclaim the throne of Mahishmati from his
      tyrannical uncle, Bhallaladeva. Starring Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, and
      Anushka Shetty, the production set new standards for Indian visual effects
      and storytelling, becoming the first Indian film to gross over ₹1,000
      crore worldwide and briefly holding the title of the highest-grossing
      Indian film of all time. As of 2026, it remains a cultural phenomenon and
      a streaming staple on platforms like Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar,
      celebrated for its Shakespearean themes of betrayal, duty, and redemption.

      <strong>The Conjuring</strong> is a seminal supernatural horror film that
      launched a massive cinematic universe by dramatizing the real-life cases
      of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The story follows the
      couple, portrayed by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, as they come to the
      aid of the Perron family, who experience increasingly terrifying and
      violent disturbances in their secluded Rhode Island farmhouse in 1971.
      Renowned for its focus on atmospheric tension and "old-school" suspense
      over excessive gore, the film was a massive critical and commercial
      success, grossing over $320 million worldwide against a modest $20 million
      budget. As of 2026, it is widely regarded as a modern horror classic that
      revitalized the haunted house subgenre, and it is currently available for
      streaming on platforms such as Max and Amazon Prime Video.

    <p>
      Released in <em>2025</em> as the direct sequel to the 2019 hit,<strong>
        Ne Zha 2 </strong
      >(also known as Ne Zha: The Demon Boy Churns the Sea) has become a
      historic cinematic phenomenon, officially ranking as the highest-grossing
      animated film of all time with over $2.24 billion in global earnings. The
      film follows the spirits of Ne Zha and Dragon Prince Ao Bing after their
      physical destruction, as they are forced to share a reconstructed body
      while undergoing three heavenly trials for immortality. Amidst its
      groundbreaking "ink-wash" animation and massive scale, the story uncovers
      a conspiracy by celestial authorities to frame the Dragon Race, evolving
      into a radical rejection of oppressive systems. By early 2026, it stands
      as the fifth highest-grossing film in history and the first non-English
      title to earn more than $2 billion globally, having set a single-territory
      record with over $2.1 billion in the Chinese market alone. Despite its
      global dominance and an English-dubbed version released by A24 featuring
      Michelle Yeoh, the film was notably absent from the 2026 Oscar nominations
      due to its producers not submitting it for consideration.
